# HackIT Platform Architecture

## Overview
HackIT is a comprehensive hackathon management platform built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It enables users to register, form teams, submit projects, and participate in hackathons.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React**: The frontend is built with React for its component-based architecture and efficient DOM updates
- **React Router**: Handles client-side routing
- **Context API**: Manages global state (auth, etc.)
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API requests

### Backend Architecture
- **Node.js & Express**: Server-side JavaScript runtime and web framework
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: NoSQL database and ODM
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens
- **Passport.js**: Authentication middleware supporting multiple strategies
- **Nodemailer**: Email delivery for invitations and notifications

## Data Models

### User Model
- Basic user information (name, email, password)
- Profile data (avatar, bio, skills)
- Authentication details (role, OAuth identifiers)
- Password reset functionality

### Team Model
- Team details (name, description)
- Members and team leader references
- Team invitations with token-based system
- Project association

### Project Model
- Project details (title, description, tech stack)
- Team association
- URLs (repository, demo, video)
- Submission status tracking
- Feedback from organizers/admins

### Submission Model (Future)
- Project reference
- Submission details
- Review status and notes
- Hackathon association

## API Structure

### Authentication Routes
- User registration and login
- OAuth authentication (GitHub, Google)
- Password reset functionality
- User profile management

### Team Routes
- Team creation, reading, updating, and deletion
- Team membership management
- Invitation system (send, accept, decline)

### Project Routes
- Project creation and management
- Submission process
- Feedback and review system

### Admin Routes
- User management
- Team oversight
- Project review and approval

## Security Considerations
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT for secure authentication
- Role-based access control
- Protected routes on both frontend and backend
- Data validation and sanitization

## Deployment Architecture
- Frontend: Static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, or similar)
- Backend: Node.js hosting (Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.)
- Database: MongoDB Atlas or self-hosted MongoDB
- Environment variables for configuration
- CORS enabled for secure cross-origin requests

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time notifications using Socket.io
- File upload for project screenshots and resources
- Advanced analytics for hackathon organizers
- Judging system for project evaluation
- Integration with version control systems
